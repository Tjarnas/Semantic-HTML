                <h3>Metal</h3>
                <p>
                    Since relatively young age I started to listen to pop-punk, heavily influenced by bands like Sum41, Green Day, Rise Against, Paramore etc etc. <br>
                    My older brother introduced me to metal - Among the first bands my brother exposed me to were Avenged Sevenfold, Atreyu, Bullet For My Valentine, and Disturbed. <br> 
                    The blistering riffs, thunderous drums, and soaring vocals that emanated from their songs instantly captured my imagination. <br> 
                    <br> 
                    I was drawn to the raw emotion, the aggressive energy, and the unapologetic nature of the music. <br>
                    As I delved deeper into the world of metal, my inspiration expanded to include countless other artists. <br> 
                    I found solace in the dark, melodic symphonies which spoke to my soul and fueled my desire to learn how to play the electric guitar.

                <h3>Rock</h3>
                <p>
                    As my love for metal grew, I began to explore related genres that shared a similar spirit of rebellion and passion. <br> 
                    One such genre that soon captured my attention was rock. While metal had initially been my gateway into the world of heavy music, rock brought a refreshing blend of melody and attitude that resonated deeply with me. <br>
                    <br>
                    While metal will always hold a special place in my heart, rock introduced itself as a dynamic sibling, sharing a lineage of raw energy and powerful emotions. <br> 
                    Together, they have enriched my musical journey, shaping my tastes and influencing my own creative endeavors. <br> 
                    From the intense heaviness of metal to the melodic allure of rock, I continue to be in awe of the transformative power that music possesses.

                <p>
                    While my musical journey had primarily revolved around the realms of metal and rock, fate had an unexpected surprise in store for me. <br> 
                    It was through my love for PC gaming that I found myself inadvertently introduced to the vibrant and pulsating world of EDM, or Electronic Dance Music. <br>
                    <br>
                    As I explored the expansive world of EDM, I found myself attending music festivals and live performances, witnessing firsthand the electrifying atmosphere that enveloped the crowds. <br> 
                    The pulsating lights, euphoric vibes, and unity among fans created an indescribable sense of euphoria and connection.
